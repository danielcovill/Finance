# Environment configuration
- `brew install python3` to get the latest version of python on MacOS
- `brew install python-tk` because Brew doesn't include tkinter 
- Needed to update env variable path to point to my brew installed python at `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3`
- Create virtual environment using command+shift+P > Create Environment
